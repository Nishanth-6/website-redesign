  background: 'Before joining UIC, I did my PhD and MS in Operations Research at the Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University. My journey to North America started at the University of Waterloo, where I obtained an MASc in Operations Research and learnt the importance of asking "Why Not?". I was born in India and grew up in Sri Lanka before heading back to Chennai for my undergraduate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.',
